In the supply and demand model of price determination, **there is never a surplus or shortage of goods at the equilibrium level**. The market always settles at the point where supply equals demand. This feature will suggest the price change (Inc/Dec) to the sales manager.

        Following laws will be used in determining the price of the product:

        - If demand increases and supply remains unchanged, then it leads to **higher price and higher quantity**.
        
        - If demand decreases and supply remains unchanged, then it leads to **lower price and lower quantity**.
        
        - If demand remains unchanged and supply increases, then it leads to **lower price and higher quantity**.

        - If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases,then it leads to **higher price and lower quantity**.
    
        The application using the demand and supply data will calculate the appropriate selling price and quantity, and show it to the sales manager, whenever he needs.
        
        One of the sample figure is shown below, showing that a shift in the demand with supply unchanged, will result in the increase of the price as well as quantity of the product.

> **Correspondence 2**

**Date:** 12 / 10 / 2015

**Feedback:**

- Most of the merits didn't focus on the **core sales activity**, like; hiring talented sales staff, improvement of sales personal.
- Complete focus to be applied on **top to bottom implementation**.
- There can be multiple features for a particular merit, with the priority assigned to each of them.

**Result:**

- Laid emphasis on problems related to core sales activity, and hence improving the merits.
- Paid special attention on complete top to bottom implementation, ie; **[Users using my system -> Problems faced by them (only for sales activity)-> Merits -> Features]**
- Multiple features for most of the merits implemented, with priority assigned to each of them.

> **Correspondence 3**

**Date:** 15 / 10 / 2015

**Feedback:**

- There were some assumptions which were made, based on the features, like; there will be informations about the customer in the system, when he visits the new customer or present customer to talk about the orders, there will be hundreds of products, "which one to show to the customers?". Mention them in your catalog. also explain their workflow.

- Explain about **how they use your system on their daily basis, to solve their problems**.

- There was **good improvement made** as compared to the second submission. **Merits are good** but some more focus on basic problem solving related to sales activity.

**Result:**

- Assumptions/Obvious content are provided in the catalog, as said during the review.
- Some daily basis problems as discussed during the last review is covered in the present catalog. A sample workflow chart is also presented.
- Emphasis laid in the basic problems, like; offering products to the clients, for both new and present customers.
